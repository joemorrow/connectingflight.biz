			What if an airline did business your way for a change?  Focused less on your credit card, and more on creating a painless travel experience.  Saw the value in knowing youâ€”and knowing people who travel like you do.  At every touchpoint, made getting there and back easier, kicked aggravation to the curb, and proved that business travel doesn't have to feel like business as usual.  It'd be amazing.
